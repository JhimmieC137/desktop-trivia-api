# Desktop Trivia API
A quiz game application created for desktops(i.e Windows, Unix, MacOS, etc). Inspired by one of the projects from Udacity's Full-stack developer course but unlike it, this API is created for a desktop application.

### How it works
This application is created using the Express.js framework and Mongodb, Check out [Udacity's trivia API](https://github.com/JhimmieC137/Udactiy-Trivia-Project/tree/main/backend) if you need help creating yours. You can also see demonstration of the Desktop trivia by running this app and the desktop app simulteanously on your local machine.
 

#### Running the app
To run the application locally, clone the repo. install node.js on your local machine and then install the dependencies by navigating to the root folder in your terminal and running the command `npm install`.

After the installation is complete or successful, start the app with the command `nodemon app`.

### Updates 
This app is still in it's beta phase, more updates to API are currently being worked on, to be added soon.

Cheers
